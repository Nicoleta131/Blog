        Celebrate Christmas in Sweden
    <br>    When winters are as long and dark as they are in Sweden, it is no surprise that Swedes take the Christmas celebration seriously. Locals start to enjoy Christmassy activities well in advance, including opening Advent calendars and enjoying Christmas markets, with the most famous one located in Stockholm's Old Town. Roaming markets go hand-in-hand with sipping on glögg (mulled wine) and indulging in gingerbread.  
    <br>    Another special date to watch out for is the day of Saint Lucia. The candlelit procession occurs on December 13 when girls and boys dress in gowns and sing in choirs together. One of St. Lucia's references means merging the darkness and light, cold and warmth, so you are guaranteed a cozy and heart-warming experience.

        "Avatar: The Way of Water" reaches new heights and explores undiscovered depths as James Cameron returns to the world of Pandora in this emotionally packed action adventure. Set more than a decade after the events of the first film, "Avatar: The Way of Water" launches the story of the Sully family (Jake, Neytiri, and their kids), the trouble that follows them, the lengths they go to keep each other safe, the battles they fight to stay alive, and the tragedies they endure. All of this against the breathtaking backdrop of Pandora, where audiences are introduced to new Na’vi cultures and a range of exotic sea creatures that populate the majestic oceans.

        Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and data visualisation. Since it's relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted by many non-programmers, such as accountants and scientists, for a variety of everyday tasks, like organising finances.
